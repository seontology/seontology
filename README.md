# SEOntology

## Description

The **SEOntology** is a framework that WordLift, other SEOs, software engineers, and knowledge graph experts developed for **content optimization**. Think of it as an operating system for your content strategy. This is an early draft.

## Features

- **Main Classes**: Our ontology provides a comprehensive coverage of various SEO elements, such as:
  - `WebPage`: The primary entity representing a specific webpage, extended from Schema.org.
  - `Query`: The query for which the webpage ranks in SERPs, usually obtained through Google Search Console.
  - `URL`: the unique identifier for the webpage.
  - `AnchorText`: the anchor text which is influenced by the Query that the WebPage ranks for.
  - `Link`: representing an internal or external link found on the webpage through crawling.
  - `Thing`: The most generic type of item, expressed as an extension of the Thing class in Schema.org.
  - `Schema`: all schema markup elements found on the webpage, in JSON-LD, or other formats.


- **Object Properties**: These define relationships between classes. For instance:
  - `hasQuery`: To indicate the queries for which a `WebPage` ranks.
  - `influencedByQuery`: Indicating the connection between the `AnchorText` and the `Query` class.
  - `hasURL`: Indicating the uniform resource locator (URL) for the `WebPage`.
  - `link`: indicating the links found on the `WebPage`.
  - `usesSchema`: indicating the schema markup used to describe the `WebPage` itself. 

- **Data Properties**: These properties store specific values related to classes. Notably:
  - `embeddingText`, `embedding`, `embeddingModel` for modeling embedding use cases with SEOntology.
  - Clicks & Impressions Metrics: `clicks7Days`, `click28Days`, `ctr7Days`, and so on for tracking webpage performance over time.
  - and more!
